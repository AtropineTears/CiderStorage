# CiderStorage

**CiderStorage** is a decentralized way of sharing files across the world using their CID, a 48-byte hash of the file encoded in base32 which comes out to a 77 byte string.

Files are split into **pieces** (256kb pieces) and these pieces are hashed to get its **CDP** (CiderDataPieces).

A file can have multiple different attributes and the user can choose what attributes they want with the file.
